		<h1>CSS</h1>
		<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>
		<p>The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.</p>

			<h2>css</h2>
			<p id="para">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate.<br>css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
		</span>
		<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>		
	</div>
		
		<p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.<br>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in GTK widget toolkit.</p>
		<p>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2 elements specified by attribute, in particular:<br>id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix.<br>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefi</p>
		<p>CSS facilitates the publication of content in multiple presentation formats based on nominal parameters. Nominal parameters include explicit user preferences, different web browsers, the type of device being used to view the content (a desktop computer or mobile device), the geographic location of the user, and many other variables.</p>
